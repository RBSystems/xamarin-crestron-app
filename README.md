# xamarin-crestron-app

### `tl;dr; This is a xamarin phone app to listen to motion and other data exposed by crestron devices.`


## Genesis

Some time (months?) back we were playing around with [crestron devices](https://www.crestron.com/solutions/market/corporate-boardroom-building-management-automation). After struggling through their UI and trying (unsuccessfully) to scrap data from that UI, we found that they had an SDK (probably this [link](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Control-Hardware-Software/Software/Development-Software/SDK-N)). Should have started there [It is regrettable in retrospect]

Anyway, we cooked up a console app that could tap into the events broadcasted by the crestron devices, but testing many devices with a console is less than ideal. 

Hence, came the idea of this app.

You open the app, add a device and it starts showing you the data points. Pretty handy actually.

## Technology used

1. Xamarin cross platform development SDK
2. Crestron SDK

## Current state of project

I am not sure if the app would still work or if the sdk is still relevant. :smile:
